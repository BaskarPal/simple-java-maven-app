Requirement from the simplilearn project -- Building a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
Expectations : 
  The following requirements should be met:
    The app should be built with Maven.
    The Tomcat server should allow remote deployment.
    The pipeline should consist of three freestyle jobs for compilation, test, and deployment respectively.
    
Design:
  Creating a Maven app
    Used a  eclipse to form the app
    For better results - forked a simple jave app
  Building it it local for verification 
    Build was locally successful 
  Freestyle pipelines for CI / CT / CD
    3 Free style job was created 
      CI job 
      -will poll SCM by a webhok for push and commit at the repo
      -Buill build the maven projec with clean package goal
      -It will all run the shell comman for convert .jar file to .war
      -Results are documented
     CT job
      -It will be linked with CI job with post build action (build other project)
      -JUNIT plugin is used to check the test coverage for the build code
      -Results are documented
     CD jon
      -It will be linked with CT jon with post build action (build other projects)
      -Build commands are executed for clean install goal for the maven app
      -Post build actions are used to deploy the build .war file to a tomcat server
      -Results are documented 
  
  Verifying the buid out put
      -CI/CT and partially deploying is successful 
  
 OPLs to be clarfied:
  -Tomcat package is not proper in my terminal
  -I insalled the package and tried the shell commands are not executed 
  -The lab terminal used for previous course was stable and installed with all needed tools
